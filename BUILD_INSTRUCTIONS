This tool depends on the following packages installed to build, their precise name may differ in your distro.

Look in "debian" or "debian_package_info" folder for information on how to build a debian package.

3. For Qt4 build(libqt4-devel,libqt4-network,libqtcore4,libqtgui4)
   For Qt5 build(qt5-base-devel or a packages that provides Qt5Core-devel,Qt5Gui-devel,Qt5Network-devel)
4. gcc
5. gcc-c++
7. cmake
8.
9. libgcrypt-devel libgcrypt11-dev
10.libsecret-devel or libsecret-1-dev( optional dependency to store keys in gnome's libsecret )
11.kde-devel( optional dependency to store keys in kde's kwallet )
12.pkg-config

To build cryfs-gui with default options,run these 5 commands from inside cryfs-gui source folder.

*****************************************************************************************************

mkdir build

cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DQT5=true -DNOSECRETSUPPORT=false -DWITH_CREATE_ENCFS=false -DINTERNAL_LXQT_WALLET=false -DNOKDESUPPORT=false -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE . ..

make

make install( or sudo make install )

*****************************************************************************************************

The build system now uses GNUInstallDirs (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/module/GNUInstallDirs.html), so pretty much all directories can be controlled properly.

meaning of different options:

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
This option tells the build process to install project's files in "/usr/".

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib
This option specifies the base directory where libraries should be installed. Normally, this is automatically detected.

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
This option tells the build process to build the project in release mode.This mode is most suitable for non developers.

-DQT5=true
This option tells the build process to build GUI components using Qt5.Set the option to "false" if you want to build using Qt4.

-DNOSECRETSUPPORT=false
This option tells the build process to add gnome's libsecret secure storage of passwords.Set this option to "true" if
you do not want libsecret's support.

-DNOKDESUPPORT=false
This option tells the build process to add KDE's secure storage of passwords.Set this option to "true" if you do not
want KDE wallet support.

-DINTERNAL_LXQT_WALLET=false
This project depends on lxqt_wallet project and it ships with an internal copy of the project. Set this option to "true"
if you want zuluCrypt to unconditionally use the internal copy of the project or to "false" to make the build process
use a system installed version if found.

-DWITH_CREATE_ENCFS=false
This option is set to off by default to discourage creation of new encfs volumes since the tool has known security issues.
Set this option to true if you want cryfs-gui to show a GUI option to create encfs volumes.
