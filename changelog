-- Add ability to generate mounting dialog with a single action(Menu->Favorites->Mount All)

version 1.2.0

-- Add French translations.

-- Add ability to auto unlock a volume from CLI.An example of how to do this is:

   cryfs_gui -d /home/mtz/cryfs.volume -b "internal"

   The "-b" option gives a passphrase storage backend to use to retrieve the password to unlock
   the volume. Currently,only 3 backends are supported:
   1. "internal" backend is always there and its backed by libgcrypt.
   2. "kwallet" is backed ny KDE wallet is a compile time dependency of the project.
   3. "gnomewallet" is backed by GNOME's libsecret and is a compile time dependency of the project.

   Set the backed to use a blank passphrase(not recommended) if you want to be able to unlock
   your volumes without being prompt for a backend password.

version 1.3.0

-- Add support for unlocking a cryfs volume using an external config file.
-- Add a GUI ability to show cryfs file system space utilization.
